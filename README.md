# portfolio
A collection of various projects and iPython notebooks that illustrate cool concepts, implement interesting algorithms, or are just generally fun. 

Some of these are adapted from final projects for coursework. Those specific projects are fairly technical, so I've identified them where necessary. I will soon be adding more general summaries to these.

Each concept/project has its own self-contained directory within the `notebooks` directory.
